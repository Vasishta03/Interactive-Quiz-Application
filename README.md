# Interactive-Quiz-Application
I've created the quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application includes:

<img width="686" alt="quiz" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff22261c-b1de-4ed4-9a62-123e0daa1335" />

- A clean, modern design with smooth transitions
- Four quiz categories with emoji icons
- Multiple-choice questions with visual feedback
- A countdown timer
- Detailed results page with score percentage
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
